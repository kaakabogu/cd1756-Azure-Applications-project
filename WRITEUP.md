## Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.
For this project, I decided to use the App Service instead of a VM because it is easier to manage, especially for someone new to web application development like myself. Additionally, considering factors such as cost, scalability, availability, and workflow, the App Service proved to be the more suitable option. Below is a comparison analysis:

### Costs
- Virtual Machine: VM can be more expensive because you pay for the compute resources whether they are fully utilized or not. Also, the underlying infrastructure needs to be managed and maintained, which can add to the operational costs.
- App Service: Generally more cost-effective for smaller applications or startups. You pay for what you use, and the infrastructure management is handled by the service, reducing operational overhead.

### Scalability
- Virtual Machine: VM offer high scalability but require manual intervention to scale up or down. This can be more complex and time-consuming.
- App Service: App Service provide automatic scaling options, making it easier to handle varying loads without manual intervention. it is designed to be elastic, making it easier to manage fluctuations in traffic. This is particularly useful for web applications and APIs.

### Availability
- Virtual Machine: You have full control over the availability configurations, including setting up load balancers and failover mechanisms. This can provide high availability but requires more effort to configure and maintain.
- App Service: App Service come with built-in high availability and disaster recovery options. They handle the underlying infrastructure, ensuring your app remains available with minimal configuration.

### Workflow
- Virtual Machine: VM offer complete control over the environment, which is beneficial for applications requiring specific OS configurations, custom software, or legacy applications. However, this also means more complexity in managing the environment.
- App Service: App Service simplify the deployment process, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure. They are ideal for modern web applications, microservices, and APIs.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

#### How will the app change per your decision, such as the application requirement or more control over the infrastructure?

Choosing Virtual Machine (VM)
- When to Choose: If my application requires specific OS configurations, custom software, or dependencies.
- Benefits: Full control over the OS, network settings, and storage, allowing for fine-tuned performance optimization and security configurations.
- Considerations: Requires more effort to manage and maintain.

Choosing App Service
- When to Choose: If I need a cost-effective, scalable, and easy-to-manage solution for web applications and APIs.
- Benefits: Abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, with automatic scaling, patching, and maintenance.
- Ideal For: Developers new to web application development.

#### List any other needs you must change to suit your application requirements.

- VM: Requires more hands-on management for security, backups, monitoring, scaling, and maintenance. Offers full control over the environment, including OS, network settings, and storage.
- App Services: Simplify many of these tasks with built-in features but may require adjustments to fit within the platform's constraints.
